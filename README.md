# Supermarket-Tofu-Sales-Analysis(Tableau)

Tofu, originally from ancient China, is now one of the most popular foods in both eastern and western countries.(https://www.forbes.com/sites/juliewilcox/2012/08/07/the-triumph-of-tofu/#632b70566871)

Due to ingredient and manufacture process of Tofu, most kind of them only have life period less than three months, even reserved in refrigerator.

So the requirement of analysis on prediction of order quantity along time is critical to a supermarket which sells a lot of tofu throughout entire year.

I chose Tableau as visualization tool to do the job , and data sets used were from an Asian supermarket in Upstate NY.
